          <p>
            Studying HTML has equipped me with a range of valuable skills.
            Firstly, I have gained a thorough understanding of the fundamental
            building blocks of web development, including HTML tags, attributes,
            and elements. I have learned how to structure and organize content
            using semantic HTML, which enhances accessibility and search engine
            optimization. Additionally, I am proficient in creating forms,
            tables, and lists, allowing for interactive and well-structured web
            pages. I have also honed my ability to troubleshoot and debug HTML
            code effectively. Overall, my HTML studies have provided me with the
            essential skills to create and manipulate the structure and content
            of web pages proficiently.
