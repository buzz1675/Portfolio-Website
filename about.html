              I am a Lockerbie-based budding software/webdeveloper. I started
              learning to code in early 2023 but interest and knowledge (albeit
              i didn't know it then) started years before. Using the resources
              on freecodecamp before moving on to CodeAcademy's Full Stack
              Engineer programme I have learned so many skills from scratch
              including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="bullet" id="bullet">+</span>
                <span class="li_hover">CSS</span>
                <div class="hidden-info">
                  <p>
                    CSS has allowed me to effortlessly style and format HTML
                    elements, giving me precise control over their appearance.
                    I've learned how to apply various selectors to target
                    specific elements or groups of elements, and manipulate
                    their properties, such as color, size, and positioning.
                    Additionally, I've discovered the power of CSS layouts,
                    which enable me to create responsive designs that adapt
                    seamlessly to different screen sizes. With CSS, I have
                    unlocked the ability to transform a simple webpage into a
                    visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </li>

              <li>
                <span class="bullet" id="bullet">+</span>
                <span class="li_hover">HTML</span>
                <div class="hidden-info">
                  <p>
                    I have acquired a comprehensive understanding of its core
                    principles and functionality. HTML has empowered me to
                    structure and organize web content effectively. I have
                    learned to use semantic tags to provide meaning and context
                    to different parts of a webpage, enhancing accessibility and
                    search engine optimization. By mastering the art of creating
                    hyperlinks, embedding images and videos, and building forms,
                    I have gained the ability to craft interactive and engaging
                    web pages. HTML has laid the foundation for my web
                    development journey, allowing me to create structured and
                    well-presented content for the online world.

                    In my journey with JavaScript, I have gained a profound
                    understanding of its immense power and versatility.
                    JavaScript has enabled me to bring dynamic and interactive
                    elements to web pages. I have learned how to manipulate the
                    Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update and modify
                    the content and structure of web pages in real-time.
                    JavaScript has equipped me with the ability to handle user
                    interactions, validate form inputs, perform calculations,
                    and implement complex functionality. By mastering concepts
                    like variables, functions, loops, and conditionals, I have
                    acquired the skills to develop robust and efficient scripts.
                    JavaScript has truly unlocked the potential for creating
                    engaging and interactive web experiences.
